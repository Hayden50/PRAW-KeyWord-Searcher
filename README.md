# Overview

This code creates a Reddit bot that searches for keywords in the most recent title of specified subreddits and alerts me when a new post is posted with a title containing that keyword. This is an infinite loop that checks for the keyword every .5 seconds and will only pause when reddit is down.

# Current Uses

In this current interation of the code, I am currently checking the r/buildapc subreddit every .5 seconds for a mention of any type of restock or the mention of the phrase "RTX," which would be referring to an Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics card. As soon as a post concerning either of those things come up, I will be alerted by the bot who sends the link to my other Reddit account.
